## Overview

Using CoronaCards, your existing Android app can leverage the full power of Corona's engine via one or more Corona-based views. These views are based on Android's `FrameLayout` and `GLSurfaceView`. They can be sized as partial or <nobr>full-screen</nobr> just like any other view.

## APIs

The native API for Android is available as [JavaDoc](html/overview-summary.html).
