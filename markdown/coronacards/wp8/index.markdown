# CoronaCards â€” Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;8

CoronaCards for Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;8 is provided as a Visual Studio Extension (`*.vsix`) file which integrates Corona's library framework and project templates into Visual Studio. It provides a Silverlight XAML control and library framework that allows you to easily leverage DirectX to render 2D content and play audio using Lua scripts. This allows you to develop your app in .NET, avoiding the complexities of bridging the C++/CX side of DirectX into your .NET app.
