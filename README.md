# Corona game engine documentation

This documentation gets deplyoed to the https://docs.coronalabs.com/

Documentation lives in `markdown/` directory. Note that it does not use GitBub flavored markdown, but rather its own flavor.

Plugin documentation lives in submodule. Mind it when checking out. Submodule documentation is auto-generated and not intended to be edited manually.

To build documentation yourself from `bin` directory run `lua build.lua`. Make sure Lua has LFS (Lua File System) accessible.
